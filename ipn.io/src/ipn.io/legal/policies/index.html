# Site Policies

Our content licensing policies are based on those of the [Google Developer](https://developers.google.com/site-policies) website.

We are pleased to license much of the content and documentation available on our sites under terms that explicitly encourage people to take, modify, reuse, re-purpose, and remix our work as they see fit.

You will find the following notice at the bottom of many pages on the Google Developers website:


> Except as noted, content licensed [CC-BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), code licensed [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

When you see a page with this notice you are free to use [nearly everything](#restrictions) on the page in your own creations. That's what open content licenses are all about. We just ask that you give us [attribution](#attribution) when you reuse our work.

<h2 id="restrictions">What is <em>not</em> licensed?</h2>

We say "nearly everything" as there are a few simple conditions that apply.

Trademarks and other brand features are not included in this license.

In some cases, a page may include content consisting of images, audio or video material, or a link to content on a different webpage (such as videos or slide decks). This content is not covered by the license, unless specifically noted.

<h2 id="attribution">Attribution</h2>

Proper attribution is required when you reuse or create modified versions of content that appears on a page made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution license. The complete requirements for attribution can be found in section 4 of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode">Creative Commons legal code</a>.

In practice we ask that you provide attribution to Interplanetary Networks to the best of the ability of the medium in which you are producing the work.

There are several typical ways in which this might apply:

<h4>Exact Reproductions</h4>

If your online work <em>exactly reproduces</em> text or images from this site, in whole or in part, please include a paragraph at the bottom of your page, or wherever convenient, that reads:

> Portions of this page are reproduced from work created and <a href="//ipn.io/legal/policies">shared by Interplanetary Networks</a> and used according to terms described in the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution License</a>.

Also, please link back to the original source page so that readers can refer to it for more information.

<h4>Modified Versions</h4>

If your online work shows <em>modified</em> text or images based on the content from this site, please include a paragraph at the bottom of your page that reads:

> Portions of this page are modifications based on work created and <a href="//ipn.io/legal/policies">shared by Interplanetary Networks</a> and used according to terms described in the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution License</a>.

Again, please link back to the original source page so that readers can refer to it for more information. This is even more important when the content has been modified.

<h4>Other Media</h4>

If you produce non-hypertext works, such as books, audio, or video, we ask that you make a best effort to include a spoken or written attribution in the spirit of the messages above.

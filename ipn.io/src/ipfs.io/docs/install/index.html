# Install IPFS

These are the install instructions for [go-ipfs](https://github.com/jbenet/go-ipfs). We will have install packages soon, but for now, we must install from source. This is easy, as most people already have the dependencies.

Dependencies:

- [Install Go 1.4](https://golang.org/doc/install) (to compile. [make sure it's 1.4](docs/install#check-go-version))
- [Install Git](http://git-scm.com/) (to download dependencies)
- *Optionally*, install [FUSE](docs/install#install-fuse) (for mounting / advanced use)

Then run:

```sh
go get -u github.com/jbenet/go-ipfs/cmd/ipfs
```

This will download ipfs and its dependencies, and compile `ipfs`. Test it out:

```
> ipfs version
ipfs version 0.2.0
```

That's it!

### Troubleshooting

#### Help!

If you have any problems, come get live help at
[#ipfs](docs/#community) or via [the mailing list](docs/#community).

#### Check Go Version

IPFS works with Go 1.4+
To check what go version you have installed, type `go version`.
Here's what I get:

```sh
> go version
go version go1.4.1 darwin/amd64
```

If you need to update, it is recommended to install from the
[canonical Go packages](https://golang.org/doc/install/).
Package managers often contain out-of-date Go packages.

#### Install FUSE

For more details on setting up FUSE (so that you can mount the filesystem), see [github.com/jbenet/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/fuse.md](https://github.com/jbenet/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/fuse.md)

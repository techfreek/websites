# Install IPFS

These are the install instructions for [go-ipfs](https://github.com/jbenet/go-ipfs). We will have install packages soon, but for now, we must install from source. This is easy, as most people already have the dependencies.

## Install From Source

### dependencies

- [Install Go 1.4](https://golang.org/doc/install) (to compile)
- [Install Git](http://git-scm.com/) (to download dependencies)

Notes:

- Package managers often contain out-of-date Go packages. Compilation from source is recommended.
- For more details on setting up FUSE (so that you can mount the filesystem), see [github.com/jbenet/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/fuse.md](https://github.com/jbenet/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/fuse.md)

### go get ipfs

Just run:

```sh
go get -u github.com/jbenet/go-ipfs/cmd/ipfs
```

This will download ipfs and its dependencies, and compile `ipfs`. Test it out:

```
> ipfs version
ipfs version 0.2.0
```

That's it!

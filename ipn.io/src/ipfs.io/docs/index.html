# The IPFS Project

IPFS is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and
identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications.
It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

IPFS is an open source project developed by the team at
[Interplanetary Networks](//ipn.io) and many contributors
from the open source community.
